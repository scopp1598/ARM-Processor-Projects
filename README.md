## ARM-Processor-Projects
# ARMS and ARMStb
These are the files for the final project of a Computer Architecture course. The goal was to build a processor in Verilog that could take a large number ARM instructions and processes them as a regular ARM chip would. ARMS is the file that contains the code for the building the actually processor and ARMStb is the testbench file for making sure it works.
# ARMS2 and ARMS2tb
These build on the previous two files with goal of adding some basic memory and multiple cores with branching and predictive hardware to make using multiple cores worth while.
